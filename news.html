        <div>Although millenials may seem to have a greater investment in health and wellness than
            generations before them, findings from the Blue shield Association (BCBSA) suggest millinnials will be substantially healthy as they age
        </div>
        <div>The Report defines the following as the top 10 conditions millennials, ranked by adverse health impact</div>
        <div>
            <ol>
                <li>Major depression</li>
                <li>Substance</li>
                <li>Alcohol use disorder</li>
                <li>Hypertension</li>
                <li>Hyperactivity</li>
                <li>Psychotic conditions</li>
                <li>CrohnÂ´s disease and ulcerative colitis</li>
                <li>High cholesterol</li>
                <li>Tobacco use disorder</li>
                <li>Type 2 diabetes</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div>"While the top 10 condition affecting millenials are not necessarily suprising,what is shocking
            is the prevalence rates for each of these conditions in millenials when compared to rates for previsous
            generations", Dr. Vincent Nelson ,vice president of medical affairs for the BCBSA,told Healthine.
        </div>
        <div>Millennials aged 34 to 36 in 2017 were 11 percent less healthy than Gen Xers aged 34 to 36 in 2014,
             and had a double digit increase in diagnoses for eight of the top 10 heath conditions.
        </div>
        <div>Still,83 percent of the 55 million millennials surveyed in 2017 considered themselves in good
            or excellent heath,despite the BCBSA analysis revealing otherwise 
        </div>
        <div>"Because significant health challenges a rising among millennials earlie than in previsous
            generations,we must address these issues now", said Nelson.
